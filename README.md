## [Lumiaura](https://compendium.xyz/portfolio/lumiaura): Where' the snowplows at?

Inspired by the heavy snow condition in Helsinki on Feb 2019. This React app shows where the city's snowplows are currently plowing and what kind of "plowing" they're doing (e.g., plowing the streets, bike lanes, pedestrian paths, etc.).

## AR Luonto: A mobile phone educational app for children

A mid-fidelity prototype project for a "[Prototyping of Digital Services](http://www.haaga-helia.fi/en/opinto-opas/opintojaksokuvaukset/DIG4TF003)" course I took in HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences. 'AR Luonto' is meant to be an iOS-based augmented reality (AR) educational app for children where they learn about the kinds of animals that live in Finland's forests or nature.
